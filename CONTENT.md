## Philosophy
Heading: Special Spiritual Celebration  
Raise your frequency, release old timelines, and step into 2026 with powerful ancient rituals. You’re not just celebrating the night you’re intentionally leaping into a higher realm of you.

## Timeline
- 🔮 19:00 – 19:30 — Doors Open – Draw Your Destiny Stone  
  Come in, settle, and draw one stone from the bucket without looking. One of the 11 stones chooses you and holds a message for the night.
- ✨ 07:30 – 09:30 — Divine Echoes and Timeline Weaving Ceremony  
  - 07:30 – 08:00: Cacao Connection — Sip Peruvian ceremonial cacao as drum and warmth open the heart.

  Expand understanding of quantum timeline work; simple exercises to meet your “2026 Quantum Self” before the jump.
- ✍️ 11:30 – 12:00 — New You Plan  
  Intentionally create a New You Plan. Each one writes it down on pen and paper.

  Midnight leap into your chosen 2026 timeline.
